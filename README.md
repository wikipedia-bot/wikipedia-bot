### 📃 About the bot

*TL;DR - it's just a amazing bot!*

The Wikipedia Bot sends you short summaries of a Wikipedia article you searched for.

You can quickly share the information about a topic on your Discord server, 
for example if you want information about a country, a game or a person.

This bot is especially focusing one goal: to deliver and share information about the world.
This bot always gets updates to provide a better service.

## 🤔 What will be coming soon?

You can check the whole progress and every new feature which is 
currently under planning and development on our new [**Notion Board**](https://www.notion.so/wikipediabot/227303c9d45646a4ac7ffdfdff0e254e?v=e4b95c24955c499fbc18eeb08b44ddea).
