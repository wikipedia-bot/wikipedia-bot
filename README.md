## Introduction

### What is this bot all about?

*TL;DR - it's just a amazing bot!*

With this bot on your server, you can search articles on Wikipedia and get short summaries of them.
With it, you can quickly share knowledge like how high the population in a country is or to get a
description of something you want to know more about.

## Contribution

Any type of contribution is welcome. Even reporting problems or giving feedback via the Issues section
does help a lot to know how to improve the bot and to fix problems with the bot.

Before developing, create a special branch for your features or fixes you want to made 
(if you want to make a pull request to this repository).

- *Fork the repository.*
- ``git checkout -b branch-name `` *(e.g. issue-fix-#1 or so)*
- ``git commit -am 'Added something / Fixed something'``
- ``git push origin branch-name``
- Make a **[pull request](https://github.com/julianYaman/wikipedia-bot/pull/new/master)**. Someone will then review your code.

## Installation guide

Before doing any development and testing of the bot, you should install all packages 
which are required with

```npm install```

Also check that you update **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** and optionally install the packages again to update them.
But in this case, [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) takes care of updating the *package.json* dependencies.
